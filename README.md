The goal of this project was to simply set up a Django environment that prints the value of a json file.

To accomplish this, most of the webapp was editted in the following path: \Wk5Lab\Wk5Lab\helloworld\views.py

The views.py file works to import a file, decipher it as a json file and print the value, according to the key "Message".


TO START:

Go to the terminal or command prompt.

CD to directory root.

Enter command: Wk5_env\Scripts\activate

CD Wk5Lab

Enter command: python manage.py runserver

In your web browser navigate to the URL specified. By default, this is usually 127.0.0.1:8000 or localhost:8000
