The goal of this project was to simply set up a Django environment that prints the value of a json file.

To accomplish this, most of the webapp was editted in the following path: \Wk5Lab\Wk5Lab\helloworld\views.py

The views.py file works to import a file, decipher it as a json file and print the value, according to the key "Message".
